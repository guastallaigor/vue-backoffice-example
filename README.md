## Quick start

This is a Vue CLI 3.0 project, so just run `npm install` and `npm run serve`.

This is very simple. Just add every new module inside the app folder. Note that this is just an advice, this is not mandatory by any means.

Example for the "Route modules": For the Example module folder, it has the `ExampleRouter.js`. Note that without the "Router" sufix, the routing system would not work properly.

/employee | List of all employees
